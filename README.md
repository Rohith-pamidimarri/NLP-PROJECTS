# BERT Tutorial: Classify Spam vs No Spam Emails

## Introduction

Welcome to the BERT Tutorial for text classification, focusing on distinguishing spam from non-spam emails. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on implementing a text classification model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in natural language processing (NLP).

## Overview

The project aims to address the challenge of classifying emails as spam or ham, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The tutorial covers key aspects such as data preprocessing, BERT embeddings, model building, training, evaluation, and inference.

## Data Preprocessing

Explore the dataset structure, address class imbalance, and downsample the majority class for balanced training. The notebook provides insights into statistical measures and ensures a robust foundation for the classification model.

## BERT Embeddings

Integrate BERT into the project using TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, and TensorFlow Text. Obtain BERT embeddings for sentences and words, and measure semantic similarity through cosine similarity calculations.

## Model Building

Implement a functional model in TensorFlow, combining BERT layers with neural network components. The tutorial includes dropout for regularization and a dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification. The model is compiled with relevant metrics.

## Training and Evaluation

Split the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance on the test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix provide a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness.

## Inference

Demonstrate how to use the trained model for making predictions on new data. Sample reviews, both spam and non-spam, showcase the model's application in real-world scenarios.

## Usage

Follow the Jupyter notebook for a detailed, hands-on implementation. The tutorial includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to enhance understanding.
